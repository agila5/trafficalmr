# Introduction

The report summarises progress on the SaferActive project, funded by the Department for Transport in support of aims outlined in the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS): to double the number of stages cycled compared with the baseline year of 2013, and "reverse the decline in walking" [@departmentfortransport_cycling_2017] **whilst reducing the casualty rate per km walked and cycled year-on-year**.

A follow-on report reviewed the safety elements of the CWIS, emphasising the importance of safety for enabling active travel and advocating measuring safety in terms of "the number of fatalities and serious injuries per billion miles" [@nathan_cycling_2019].
In this report we outline methods of estimating safety in the more commonly used units of killed and seriously injured per billion km (KSI/bkm), and outline progress in collecting, analyising and modelling datasets that will be used in subsequent steps of the project.

# Research landscape

A range of traffic calming measures can reduce casualty rates, a topic that has received much interest in the academic literature [e.g. @akbari_traffic_2020; @bunn_traffic_2003; @zalewski_traffic_2019; @zein_safety_1997; @bornioli_effectiveness_2018].
Recent papers have found strong evidence for 'safety in numbers' (increasing the argument for research into cycling uptake alongside road safety interventions) and the effectiveness of 20 mph speed limits for reducing risk to pedestrians [@aldred_cycling_2018; @cook_twenty_2020].
Less attention has been paid to the question of how road safety measures can simultaneously reduce casualty rates *and increase levels of cycling and walking* [@brown_evidence_2017]:

> Limited evidence exists on secondary effects of investment in traffic calming and safety, including effects on rates of transport-related physical activity (active transport)

This suggests that there is a need for research that measures at least two outcomes from traffic calming and other road safety measures, that this project will investigate in parallel:

- Reduction in casualty rates
- Increase in active travel

# Policy drivers

Objective 3 of the CWIS is to "reduce the rate of cyclists killed or seriously injured on England's roads,
measured as the number of fatalities and serious injuries per billion miles cycled." 
Metrics to support this objective include: KSI/bkm, slight injuries per bkm, urban/rural/regional split of crashes, and proportion of cyclists/drivers stating that it's too dangerous to cycle.
There is no parallel target for pedestrian safety.
<!-- To check -->

A rapid evidence assessment was commissioned by the Department for Transport in 2018 to identify promising intervention types in support of walking and cycling safety [@natcen_cycling_2018].
Section 6.1, focusing on infrastructure and road signs interventions, found that there is evidence for the effectiveness of a range of interventions can be effective in reducing casualty rates, including 'pedestrian refuge islands', speed humps and speed cameras.
Evidence was also reviewed of the effectiveness of cycleways, junction/roundabout design, signal controls, street lighting and 'safe routes to school'.
Section 6.2 found evidence of legislative changes, particularly speed limit reductions and expenditure on road safety policing.
Again, no UK-specific studies were identified.

A 2 year road safety action plan was set out in 2019, although the emphasis of this report was on education of drivers rather than traffic calming measures in the context of the CWIS (which is mentioned only once in the report), although the report does emphasise the importance of 20 mph zones [@departmentfortransport_road_2019].

The CWIS Safety Review provides the most detailed government document to date on road safety measures specifically designed to support walking and cycling and contained much evidence and a number of case studies of effective interventions [@departmentfortransport_cycling_2018].
Chapter 5 of this review focusses on infrastructure, with comments on cycling design guidance which have since been incorporated into the widely used Design Manual for Roads and Bridges in May 2020 [@highwaysengland_cd_2020].
There are still no legally binding national standards for local authorities meaning that many cycleways do not meet guidance such as a 1.5 m minimum cycleway width.

**An issue with the policy and research landscapes is that available evidence on road safety interventions is not easily actionable.** 
An aim of this project is to make available evidence more actionable, while simultaneously generating more evidence of the effectiveness of different interventions.

# Road safety interventions

A wide range of interventions can be undertaken to support road safety objectives.
Interventions that have been mentioned in the research and policy contexts above are outlined below, with reference to data availability.

- Speed limit reductions include '20 mph limits' (implemented only via signage) and '20 mph zones' (which involve physical traffic calming measures and can include optional measures such as speed cameras) [@maher_20mph_2018; @rospa_guide_2019]
  - Data on the prevalence of 20 mph zones can be obtained from OpenStreetMap, although it is not always clear when interventions took place.
  - The Ordnance Survey has data on legal speed limits and real world traffic speeds and we are in conversation with them to obtain these datasets for use in our work.
- A related intervention is the installation of speed cameras. 
  - We are not aware of any national dataset on speed cameras that could be used for this study.
- Traffic Regulation Orders report interventions such as contraflow cycleways and other changes
  - Data on TROs should be available open access from https://www.thegazette.co.uk
- The location and nature of physical traffic calming infrastructure, including various types of speed humps and raised junctions, plus a range of additional traffic calming measures [@departmentfortransport_traffic_2007]. These can be obtained from multiple sources, including:
  - Traffic calming infrastructure in OSM
  - The Cycling Infrastructure Database in London
  - Ordnance Survey Topo layer
  
## Other types of intervention

Other interventions may not have been implemented primarily for road safety reasons, but may nevertheless reduce cycle and pedestrian casualty rates alongside other aims such as increasing cycling levels or reducing road traffic.

- The installation of cycle superhighways or cycle lanes. 
- 'Filtered permeability' interventions including point closures of roads, for example by rising and fixed bollards.
- Larger scale interventions, including Mini-Holland schemes.

Again, data sources for these measures will include:
  - TfL Cycling Action Plan
  - Cycling infrastructure in OSM
  - The Cycling Infrastructure Database in London
  - Ordnance Survey Topo layer

# Data collection and processing

During the first three months of the project we have focussed on data collection, development of methods and descriptive data analysis/visualisation.

## Obtaining traffic calming interventions from OSM

Data on traffic interventions were obtained from OSM, using the tag [`traffic_calming`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:traffic_calming), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tcmap) and summarised in Table \@ref(tab:tctab).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Visualisation

## Interactive visualisation

We have explored visualisation options and we are using a state of the art R solution to power our production web application. The technicalities of the solution can be added somewhere else in the project but the solution is a modern front with a RESETful API which would mean the data is available for the users for transparency and reuse. The other scalable front end solution we are currently developing for the purpose of this project is inspired the smartphone ecosystem.

```{r vis1, fig.cap="Using R to develop the fron-end using Turing eAtlas npm package"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/408568/86475297-4e71f500-bd3c-11ea-921c-e4cca9683201.png")
```

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/vector_tiles.png")
```


## Heat map

Another option we have explored is 'heatmap' visualisations, as shown in a prototype web application currently hosted at https://saferactive.github.io/ and shown in Figure \@ref(fig:heatmap1).

```{r heatmap1, fig.cap="Prototype interactive visualisation of road crashes with a heatmap."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/shiny-app-1.png")
```

## Who-hit-who

When studying road crash data, there is often detailed qualitative context that is important to analyse. For example, it may be desirable to explore the categories of traveler/vehicle types involved in collisions.
A recent and successful example of a tool aimed at effecting such comparisons is [who-hit-who](https://www.hetongeluk.nl/statistieken/andere_partij?period=2020).
A screenshot appears in Figure \@ref(fig:who1), but this is essentially an interactive web-page displaying pair-wise frequencies of travelers/vehicle types involved in fatalities in the Netherlands.
As part of our visualization design work, we will also explore incorporating these sorts of matrix views for characterizing crashes into our web-based visualization tool.
For example, these sorts of summaries views could be introduced as dynamic legends (e.g. Dykes et al. 2010), where the data displayed changes according to the spatial filter and zoom level of the main map view.


```{r who1, fig.cap="Screenshot taken from the who-hit-who tool."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/87161600-aa002d80-c2bc-11ea-9d81-f3e3c3857bd3.png")
```

There are nevertheless problems with these sorts of matrix views. They are not particularly space-efficient; most positions in the matrix above are empty.
The matrix in Figure \@ref(fig:who1) does not immediately convey an order – it is necessary to perform some scanning of the rows and columns to identify the first, second and third most commonly occurring vehicle-to-vehicle combination.  Additionally, the graphic considers only pairwise combinations of vehicle types; it is possible that some crashes may involve more than two categories of vehicle.

An alternative is Upset (Lex et al. 2014).  Upset plots organise co-occurring variables into discrete sets and summarises over the sets using bars, with an accompanying legend describing the composition of each set. In Figure \@ref(fig:who2), an example is applied to road crash data in England for 2018, accessed via Stats19 (Lovelace et al. 2019).  The plot has three components: the main bar chart shows each discrete combination of vehicle involved in crashes in the Stats19 dataset, ordered left-to-right according to frequency. Beneath this is a matrix clarifying what each combination represents, with vehicle combinations indicated via filled dots and emphasised with connecting lines. 

By far the most common vehicle-to-vehicle combination is car-to-car. After this, collisions between cars and pedestrians, bicycles and motorcycles occur in reasonably large numbers. Notice that there are crashes involving more than two vehicle categories: most notable is car-van-HGV combination in column 8.  With interaction it is possible to flexibly re-order upset plots, so rather than ordering according to intersection size, we may wish to order according to intersection degree – that is, the number of distinct vehicle types involved in a collision. Notice that in Figure \@ref(fig:who2), we have chosen to provide an additional summary graphic for each set intersection – in this case relative accident severity. The apparently high severity levels for set combinations towards the right-end of the graphic should be read cautiously as they are based on very low frequencies. However, a noticeable higher KSI rate (close to 50%) can be observed for crashes involving cars and HGVs.

```{r who2, fig.cap="Upset plot displaying vehicle combinations involved in crashes in 2018 in England. Source: Stats19."}

```


# Analyis

We have developed a methodology to estimate the casualty rate per billion km for walking and cycling.

Casualty data is available from stats19, broken down into fatal, serious and slight casualties. We have filtered these by mode of travel, identifying cyclist and pedestrian casualties. 

To obtain KSI/bkm for cycle casualties, we have estimated the number of kilometers cycled in each London Borough. Using 2011 census data for travel to work and Cyclestreets.net 'fast' routing options, we create a route network. Each road segment within the route network is assigned to a London Borough based on its centroid location. Multiplying the number of cyclists using each segment by the length of the segment thus gives the number of km cycled within each Borough. 

To obtain sufficient sample size we used stats19 casualty data for the years 2009 - 2013. However, our estimate of km cycled only covers one-way commuter journeys on a single day in 2011. Therefore we filter the stats19 data to include only accidents taking place during the rush hour peak periods (07:30-09:30 and 16:30-18:30) on weekdays. We then divided the number of casualties by two (to represent one-way journeys), then by five (to represent a single year) and again by 261 (to represent a single day). 

Corrections were also made to account for changes in accident reporting systems. In recent years, many police forces across the UK have switched to injury based reporting systems. This has altered the proportions of casualties recorded as having 'serious' and 'slight' injuries. To control for these changes, casualty-level correction values were used, as recommended in [@departmentfortransport_annex_2019].

Initial results show some clear patterns. Cycling levels are highest in Inner London, with one-way commuter journey km cycled ranging from 58,410 km in Westminster to 1060 km in Harrow. Cycle casualties are also greatest in Inner London and mean annual adjusted KSI values for the period 2009-2013 (including weekday peak hour data only) range from 24.8 casualties per year in Westminster to 1.8 casualties per year in Barking and Dagenham. 

```{r fig1, fig.cap = "Total km cycled (one-way commuter journeys from 2011 census) and total KSI (2009 - 2013) using casualty severity adjustments for non-injury based reporting systems"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cycle-totals.png")
```

There is a strong negative relationship between km cycled and KSI/bkm. Inner London Boroughs have greater km cycled and lower KSI/bkm, despite having a higher total number of casualties. By contrast, Outer London Boroughs have fewer km cycled and higher KSI/bkm. The results for slight injuries closely mirror those for serious injuries and fatalities.

```{r fig2, fig.cap = "KSI and slight injuries per bkm for London Boroughs 2009 - 2013"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cycle-KSI-bkm.png")
```

Further analyses will examine the nature of the relationship between km cycled and KSI/bkm. Initial findings suggest that this may be a exponential decay relationship, as seen in Figure 

```{r fig3, fig.cap = "Relationship between KSI/bkm and number of km cycled in each Borough"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/km-cycled-KSI.png")
```

We plan to use a similar method to estimate walking levels and KSI/bkm in each London Borough. This will also be based on travel to work 2011 census data.

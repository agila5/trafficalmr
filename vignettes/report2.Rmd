# Software development

One of the objectives of the project was to develop software to enable access to data on traffic calming interventions.
We have progressed with the development of the `trafficalmr` package for reproducible road safety analysis, supporting the project and other projects on road safety.
We would like feedback from stakeholders: is it easy to use? what additional functionality would you like to see? The list of functions provided by the package can be found here: https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/reference/index.html

# Temporal analysis

We have analysed the DfT's manual traffic count data to explore it's potential to provide estimates of the geographic distribution of cycling uptake over time.
Preliminary results, based on a General Additive Model (GAM) are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gam1).

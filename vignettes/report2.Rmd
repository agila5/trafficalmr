# Software development

One of the objectives of the project was to develop software to enable access to data on traffic calming interventions.
We have progressed with the development of the `trafficalmr` package for reproducible road safety analysis, supporting the project and other projects on road safety.
We would like feedback from stakeholders: is it easy to use? what additional functionality would you like to see? The list of functions provided by the package can be found here: https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/reference/index.html

# Temporal analysis

We have analysed the DfT's manual traffic count data to explore it's potential to provide estimates of the geographic distribution of cycling uptake over time.
Preliminary results, based on a General Additive Model (GAM) are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gam1).

```{r gam1, fig.cap="Preliminary estimates of cycling uptake in London boroughs relative to 2011 levels, 2000-2018. A selection of boroughs of interest are highlighted for reference.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cycle-uptake-la-london-smoothed.png")
```

Building on results for London, we scaled-up the approach to provide nationwide spatio-temporal estimates of cycling.

# Geographic data analysis

Building on methods we initially developed for the [CyIPT](https://www.cyipt.bike/) project, we have developed new techniques for allocating crashes to features on the road network, such as junctions and road sections.
Preliminary results comparing CyIPT results and results from this project are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cyipt-crash).

```{r cyipt-crash, fig.cap="CyIPT methods for allocating crashes to juctions (left) compared with preliminary results of updated methods developed for the SaferActive project (right).", out.width="50%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cyipt-crashes1.png",
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cyipt-crashes2.png"
))
```




The method works as follows.

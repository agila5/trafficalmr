# Software development

One of the objectives of the project was to develop software to enable access to data on traffic calming interventions.
We have progressed with the development of the `trafficalmr` package for reproducible road safety analysis, supporting the project and other projects on road safety.
We would like feedback from stakeholders: is it easy to use? what additional functionality would you like to see? The list of functions provided by the package can be found here: https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/reference/index.html

# Temporal analysis

We analysed the DfT's manual traffic count data to explore its potential to provide estimates of the geographic distribution of cycling uptake over time.
There is an uneven number of locations where annual average daily flow estimates are available, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:aadf-counts-per-year).

```{r aadf-counts-per-year, fig.cap="AADF counts per year in the DfT's traffic counter dataset", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/aadf-counts-per-year.png",
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/aadf-counts-per-year-2-plus.png"
  ))
```

Taking 5,361 count locations which had continuous readings in the 10 years from 2010 to 2019, we were able to generate estimates of cycling uptake at the local authority level.
These are presented, relative to 2011 cycling levels, in Figure \@ref(fig:aadf-uptake-2011-multiplier-line-mean).

```{r aadf-uptake-2011-multiplier-line-mean, fig.cap="Cycling uptake estimates for all local authorities in Great Britain. Black line width represents the number of counters in each local authority, the white line represents no cycling uptake, and the red line is the weighted mean for all cycle counters from 2010 to 2019.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/aadf-uptake-2011-multiplier-line-mean.png")
```


Preliminary results, based on a General Additive Model (GAM) are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gam1).

```{r gam1, fig.cap="Preliminary estimates of cycling uptake in London boroughs relative to 2011 levels, 2000-2018. A selection of boroughs of interest are highlighted for reference.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cycle-uptake-la-london-smoothed.png")
```

Building on results for London, we scaled-up the approach to provide nationwide spatio-temporal estimates of cycling.

# Geographic data analysis

Building on methods we initially developed for the [CyIPT](https://www.cyipt.bike/) project, we have developed new techniques for allocating crashes to features on the road network, such as junctions and road sections.
Preliminary results comparing CyIPT results and results from this project are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cyipt-crash).

```{r cyipt-crash, fig.cap="CyIPT methods for allocating crashes to juctions (left) compared with preliminary results of updated methods developed for the SaferActive project (right).", out.width="40%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cyipt-crashes1-2.png",
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cyipt-crashes2.png"
))
```


The method works as follows.

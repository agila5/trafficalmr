# Software development

One of the objectives of the project was to develop software to enable access to data on traffic calming interventions.
We have progressed with the development of the `trafficalmr` package for reproducible road safety analysis, supporting the project and other projects on road safety.
We would like feedback from stakeholders: is it easy to use? what additional functionality would you like to see? The list of functions provided by the package can be found here: https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/reference/index.html

# Temporal analysis

We analysed the DfT's manual traffic count data to explore its potential to provide estimates of the geographic distribution of cycling uptake over time.
There is an uneven number of locations where annual average daily flow estimates are available, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:aadf-counts-per-year).

```{r aadf-counts-per-year, fig.cap="AADF counts per year in the DfT's traffic counter dataset", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/aadf-counts-per-year.png",
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/aadf-counts-per-year-2-plus.png"
  ))
```

Taking 3,049 count locations which had continuous readings in the 10 years from 2010 to 2019 (representing 35% of the total counts in these years), we were able to generate estimates of cycling uptake at the local authority level.
These are presented, relative to 2011 cycling levels, in Figure \@ref(fig:aadf-uptake-2011-multiplier-line-mean), showing an upward trend in cycling uptake in the years 2010-2014. 

```{r aadf-uptake-2011-multiplier-line-mean, fig.cap="Cycling uptake estimates for all local authorities in Great Britain. Black line width represents the number of counters in each local authority, the white line represents no cycling uptake, and the red line is the weighted mean for all cycle counters from 2010 to 2019.", out.width="100%"}

```

We can further investigate cycle flows on different types of road. For count points with continuous readings in the years 2010-2019, 75% are on 'C' and unclassified roads, 24% on 'B' roads, and less than 1% on principal or trunk 'A' roads. By comparison, of all count points during these years, 47% of counts are on 'C' and unclassified roads, 14% on 'B' roads, 31% on principal 'A' roads and 8% on trunk 'A' roads.

Of the road types studied, mean AADF is highest on Principal 'A' roads at 214 cycles per day, and lowest on Trunk 'A' roads at 2.4 cycles per day. On Trunk 'A' roads, zero cyclists were recorded at 34% of counts; many of these may represent locations on major national routes that are unsuitable for most cyclists. However, the increase in cycling uptake during the years 2010-2014 corresponds to counts from minor roads ('B', 'C' and unclassified roads). These roads that 

Using all cycle count points in London over the years 2010-2019, we produced a GAM model 

Preliminary results, based on a General Additive Model (GAM) are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gam1).

```{r gam1, fig.cap="Preliminary estimates of cycling uptake in London boroughs relative to 2011 levels, 2000-2018. A selection of boroughs of interest are highlighted for reference.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cycle-uptake-la-london-smoothed.png")
```

Building on results for London, we scaled-up the approach to provide nationwide spatio-temporal estimates of cycling. 

The national GAM model has smooth terms for the variables year, space and road category.

# Geographic data analysis

Building on methods we initially developed for the [CyIPT](https://www.cyipt.bike/) project, we have developed new techniques for allocating crashes to features on the road network, such as junctions and road sections.
Preliminary results comparing CyIPT results and results from this project are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cyipt-crash).

```{r cyipt-crash, fig.cap="CyIPT methods for allocating crashes to juctions (left) compared with preliminary results of updated methods developed for the SaferActive project (right).", out.width="40%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cyipt-crashes1-2.png",
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/figures/cyipt-crashes2.png"
))
```


The objective of this part of the project is to increase to measure to level of risk of collisions at a very high level of spatial detail. Ideally we seek to use historical data to identify specific roads and junctions which are especially dangerous and thus need to be fixed.

The first stage of the process is to separate crashes which occurred at junctions, and those that did not.  Junctions are a known “hotspot” for collisions thus should be treated separately from roads in general.  Fortunately the stats19 data indicated whether a collision occurred at or near a junction.
The second stage of the process it to simplify the road and junction network for analysis.  This is a complex multistage process, but the overall objective is to reduce the road network so simple an easily comprehensible from by excluding and aggregating unnecessary details. For example, a single road will be represented within the OpenStreetMap as many geometries. For our purposes, a single line representing the main centreline of the road is sufficient. Thus small details just a turning lanes, or alleyways are removed and road segments are combined into a single linestring.  Road segments are grouped by road name and reference allowing for “human legible” road units to be constructed. In the case of very long roads (over 1km) roads are broken into 500m sections.

Junctions are similarly simplified.  Firstly, all junction points are extracted from the OSM. Junction points are then clustered together to reflect how we naturally think about junctions.  For example, a roundabout is a single large junction not 4 - 10 small junctions arranged in a circle. Here a balance has to be struck between making the clusters large enough that big complex junctions are grouped together, while not being so large that densely packed urban streets become a single super-junction. We found a 15 metre buffer to be the optimal size for coalescing junction clusters.

The third stage is to associate the point crash data with the appropriate road or junction. Here we had to balance accuracy against performance.  Measuring the distance between every crash and every road would take an inordinate about of time.  Thus we must use cleaver shortcuts to reduce to computational load without risking incorrectly matching crashed and roads.

Once matching is completed is it possible to map the number of crashes or casualties for each road and junction over the last 10 years.
